# The Aberfeldie Node: A Simple Guide

Welcome to the **Aberfeldie Node**. This document explains how your autonomous trading bot works in plain English, without the jargon.

## 1. The Core Philosophy: "Money at War"

The bot follows a single, aggressive rule: **Idle cash is losing money.**

In the past, the bot was cautious, waiting for "perfect" opportunities. Now, it treats your brokerage account like a battlefield where every dollar must be "at war" to earn its keep. 
*   **The Target**: The bot aims to keep at least **85%** of your money invested at all times.
*   **The Benchmark**: It knows that any cash not invested could be sitting in your mortgage offset account saving you interest. If it can't find a stock that it expects will beat that mortgage rate, it looks for the next best opportunity to deploy that capital.

## 2. Life on the Watchlist: The "Rising Star" Army

The bot doesn't look at the whole stock market. It focuses on a hand-picked "Army" of 18 world-class companies, including:
*   **The AI Titans**: NVDA, AMD, MU (Microchips, memory, and HBM).
*   **The Big Tech Anchors**: AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, META (The giants of the S&P 500).
*   **The Disruptors**: TSLA (Electric cars), PLTR (AI software), COIN (Crypto).
*   **The Growth Monopolies**: ASML (Lithography), LLY (Global healthcare).
*   **The Infrastructure Bottleneck**: VRT (Cooling), CEG (Nuclear/AI Energy), TSM (Massive chip packaging).
*   **The Safety Anchors**: LMT (Defense), GOLD (Gold mining).

## 3. How the Bot Thinks (The Brain)

Every single minute, the bot "wakes up" and performs a three-step mental check for every stock it's watching:

### Step 1: The Math (Technicals)
It looks at the price charts. Is the stock "oversold" (on sale) or "overbought" (too expensive)? It uses a tool called **Bollinger Bands** to see if the price has drifted too far from its normal path.

### Step 2: The News (AI Sentiment)
The bot uses **Google Gemini 2.0 Flash** (a powerful AI) to read the latest news. It asks: *"Is the world feeling good or bad about this company right now?"* 
Even if there's no news, the AI looks at the general market mood and analyst reports to give the stock a "Confidence Score."

### Step 3: The Health Check (Fundamentals)
It looks at the company's real bank account. Does it make a profit? Is its debt under control? It calculates an **F-Score** (a 0-to-9 health rating). It generally avoids companies with "broken" balance sheets unless the AI is extremely certain of a turnaround.

## 4. How the Bot Behaves (The Strategist)

### The "Conviction Swap"
If the bot sees a stock you own is becoming "weak" (low conviction) and sees a "Rising Star" on the sidelines that it loves more, it will **fire the weak stock** and hire the new one immediately. It's constantly upgrading the quality of your portfolio.

### Taking Profits
The bot isn't greedy. If a stock goes up **5%**, it automatically sells half of it to "lock in" the win. It then lets the other half run, but keeps a "trailing stop" behind it—if the stock starts to drop, the bot exits before the profit disappears.

### Market Defense (The Hedge)
When the overall market gets "scary" (high volatility/VIX), the bot can buy **PSQ** (an insurance policy that goes UP when the NASDAQ goes DOWN). 
*   **AI Veto**: Unlike a dumb computer, the bot asks the AI before buying insurance. If the market is dipping but the AI thinks it's a "false alarm," the bot will skip the insurance to save you the cost.

## 5. Summary: What to Expect

*   **Aggression**: You will see small, frequent trades as the bot rebalances your "Army."
*   **Transparency**: Every decision is logged with a reason, like "RSI Oversold" or "Gemini Vetoed Hedge."
*   **Safety**: Even though it's aggressive, it still uses stop-losses to ensure no single "Rising Star" can cause a catastrophe.

In short: The Aberfeldie Node is a **hyper-active, AI-powered fund manager** that works 24/7 to ensure your capital is never sitting idle.

## 6. The Army Roster: Meet the Troops

Here is the current list of 18 world-class companies your bot is watching, and the role each one plays in your portfolio:

### The AI Titans (The Engines of Growth)
*   **NVDA (NVIDIA)**: The undisputed king of AI chips; their hardware is the foundation of every modern data center.
*   **AMD (Advanced Micro Devices)**: The primary challenger in AI and high-performance computing; vital for a competitive market.
*   **MU (Micron Technology)**: Provides the specialized high-bandwidth memory that allows AI "brains" to process data at lightning speed.

### The Big Tech Anchors (Stability & Cash Flow)
*   **AAPL (Apple)**: The world’s premium consumer platform; a fortress of brand loyalty and massive cash reserves.
*   **MSFT (Microsoft)**: Leading the enterprise revolution with Azure cloud and AI "Copilots" for every worker.
*   **AMZN (Amazon)**: The backbone of global e-commerce and the leader in cloud infrastructure (AWS).
*   **META (Meta Platforms)**: Dominates global attention through its social apps and is a leader in open-source AI models.

### The Disruptors (High Velocity Innovation)
*   **TSLA (Tesla)**: Far more than just an EV company; a bet on the future of robotics and autonomous transport.
*   **PLTR (Palantir)**: The AI "operating system" used by the most secretive governments and successful enterprises.
*   **COIN (Coinbase)**: The primary gateway to the crypto economy; as digital assets grow, so does their influence.

### The Growth Monopolies (Best in Class)

*   **LLY (Eli Lilly)**: A healthcare titan transforming global health with revolutionary treatments for weight loss and obesity.

### The Infrastructure Bottleneck (The Power & Cooling Play)
*   **VRT (Vertiv Holdings)**: AI chips generate massive heat; Vertiv build the cooling systems that keep them from melting.
*   **CEG (Constellation Energy)**: The AI boom needs power; Constellation provides the steady, carbon-free nuclear energy that data centers crave.
*   **TSM (Taiwan Semiconductor)**: The factory for the world; they manufacture the physical chips designed by Apple, Nvidia, and AMD.

### The Safety Anchors (Defense & Hedges)
*   **LMT (Lockheed Martin)**: The premier defense contractor; a bet on national security and advanced aerospace technology.
*   **GOLD (Barrick Gold)**: A classic safety play that tends to rise when inflation is high or the world gets scary.
