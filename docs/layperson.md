# The Aberfeldie Node: A Simple Guide

Welcome to the **Aberfeldie Node**. This document explains how your autonomous trading bot works in plain English, without the jargon.

## 1. The Core Philosophy: "Money at War"

The bot follows a single, aggressive rule: **Idle cash is losing money.**

In the past, the bot was cautious, waiting for "perfect" opportunities. Now, it treats your brokerage account like a battlefield where every dollar must be "at war" to earn its keep. 
*   **The Target**: The bot aims to keep at least **85%** of your money invested at all times.
*   **The Benchmark**: It knows that any cash not invested could be sitting in your mortgage offset account saving you interest. If it can't find a stock that it expects will beat that mortgage rate, it keeps looking until it does.

## 2. Life on the Watchlist: The "Rising Star" Army

The bot doesn't look at the whole stock market. It focuses on a hand-picked "Army" of 15 world-class companies, including:
*   **The AI Titans**: NVDA, AMD, MU (Microchips and memory).
*   **The Big Tech Anchors**: AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, META (The giants of the S&P 500).
*   **The Disruptors**: TSLA (Electric cars), PLTR (AI software), COIN (Crypto).
*   **The Growth Monopolies**: ASML (The machines that make chips), LLY (Global healthcare).
*   **The Safety Anchors**: LMT (Defense), GOLD (Gold mining).

## 3. How the Bot Thinks (The Brain)

Every time the bot "wakes up" (every few minutes), it performs a three-step mental check for every stock it's watching:

### Step 1: The Math (Technicals)
It looks at the price charts. Is the stock "oversold" (on sale) or "overbought" (too expensive)? It uses a tool called **Bollinger Bands** to see if the price has drifted too far from its normal path.

### Step 2: The News (AI Sentiment)
The bot uses **Google Gemini 2.0 Flash** (a powerful AI) to read the latest news. It asks: *"Is the world feeling good or bad about this company right now?"* 
Even if there's no news, the AI looks at the general market mood and analyst reports to give the stock a "Confidence Score."

### Step 3: The Health Check (Fundamentals)
It looks at the company's real bank account. Does it make a profit? Is its debt under control? It calculates an **F-Score** (a 0-to-9 health rating). It generally avoids companies with "broken" balance sheets unless the AI is extremely certain of a turnaround.

## 4. How the Bot Behaves (The Strategist)

### The "Conviction Swap"
If the bot sees a stock you own is becoming "weak" (low conviction) and sees a "Rising Star" on the sidelines that it loves more, it will **fire the weak stock** and hire the new one immediately. It's constantly upgrading the quality of your portfolio.

### Taking Profits
The bot isn't greedy. If a stock goes up **5%**, it automatically sells half of it to "lock in" the win. It then lets the other half run, but keeps a "trailing stop" behind it—if the stock starts to drop, the bot exits before the profit disappears.

### Market Defense (The Hedge)
When the overall market gets "scary" (high volatility/VIX), the bot can buy **PSQ** (an insurance policy that goes UP when the NASDAQ goes DOWN). 
*   **AI Veto**: Unlike a dumb computer, the bot asks the AI before buying insurance. If the market is dipping but the AI thinks it's a "false alarm," the bot will skip the insurance to save you the cost.

## 5. Summary: What to Expect

*   **Aggression**: You will see small, frequent trades as the bot rebalances your "Army."
*   **Transparency**: Every decision is logged with a reason, like "RSI Oversold" or "Gemini Vetoed Hedge."
*   **Safety**: Even though it's aggressive, it still uses stop-losses to ensure no single "Rising Star" can cause a catastrophe.

In short: The Aberfeldie Node is a **hyper-active, AI-powered fund manager** that works 24/7 to ensure your capital is never sitting idle.
